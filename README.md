# LoRaChat

A LoRa Chat long-distance communication using LoRa technology and ESP32 LoRa boards. You can connect to your devices via phone using a Bluetooth Serial Terminal.
We are using the [LoRaMesher](https://github.com/LoRaMesher/LoRaMesher) which allows us a LoRa Mesh communication protocol to build the routing tables and the contact lists. Large messages are possible using LargePayloads feature.
