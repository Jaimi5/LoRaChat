# Git blame ignore revisions
# This file contains commit hashes that should be ignored by git blame
# to preserve meaningful history by skipping mass formatting/style changes.
#
# To use this file automatically:
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Normalize line endings (CRLF→LF) and apply clang-format
# Date: 2025-11-01
# Description: Mass formatting change - converted all line endings from CRLF to LF
#              and applied clang-format with Google-inspired style across the entire
#              codebase (122 files). No functional changes.
